            <p>Queen Nzinga Mbande was a 17th century African ruler of the Ndongo (1624 - 1663) and Matamba (1631 - 1633) Kingdoms of the Mbundo people in Angola. She fought for the freedom and recognition of her kingdoms against the Portuguese. She served as an representitive for her brother, King Ngola Mbande, at peace negotiations and demonstrated great political and diplomatic skills. When her brother died in 1924, she inherited the throne. She faced severe opposition from males from other noble families who wanted to claim the throne. According to Mbande tradition, neither Nzinga nor her brother before her had a direct right to the throne because they were children of slave wives, not the first wife. Nzinga countered this argument with her wisdom, strategically using the claim that she was properly descended from the main royal line through her father, as opposed the claimants who had no bloodline connection. Her opponents, on the other hand, used other precedents to discredit her, such as that she was a female and thus ineligible. In addition, Nzinga's negotiation with the Portuguese (as opposed to previous rulers, whom had fought against them) was seen as a sign of weakness by some of the Ndongan nobility.

            <p>At the time, the kingdom was under attack from both Portuguese as well as neighboring African aggressors. Nzinga realised that she had more chance of saving her land if she allied with the Portuguese to fight against her other opponents. This also included the benefit of ending Portugal's slave raid in her kingdom. However in 1626, Ndongo was betrayed by the Portuguese, forcing her and her people to flee west, where they founded a new state at Matamba, out of the clutches of the Portuguese. There, Nzinga offered sanctuary to runaway slaves and Portuguese-trained African soldiers. She also adopted a form of military organization known as kilombo, in which young people cut all family ties and were raised together in militias. She also fomented rebellion within Ndongo itself, which was now governed indirectly by the Portuguese through a puppet ruler (a ruler who is controlled by outside forces; their purpose is just to hold the title). Nzinga gained an ally in the Netherlands, which seized Luanda for its own commercial purposes in 1641. Their combined forces were unsuccessful in driving the Portuguese out of Angola and after Luanda was seized once more by the Portuguese, she was again forced to retreat to Matamba. After that, Nzinga focused on developing Matamba as a trading power by utilising its position as the gateway to the interior of Central Africa. By the time of her death in 1663, Nzinga had transformed Matamba into a formidable commercial state that rivalled the Portuguese colony on an equal footing.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Queen Nzinga left a legacy to the people of the world to keep fighting until the last breath. In Brazil Nzinga was viewed as a symbol of pride among the population that were slaves. Nzinga has been an inspiration to the Angolan people in the “14 year Angolan War of Independence” (1961-1974) in which the country fought for its independence against the Portuguese. She even has a statue dedicated to her where women often go to pray and get married. The statue stands as a symbol of strength and courage to the people of Angola and is located in Kinaxixi Square </p>
